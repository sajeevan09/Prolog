# Prolog Projects

This repository contains my Prolog practice programs, focused on AI and logic programming concepts.  
Each file explores how logical rules and facts can be used to represent and reason about knowledge. 


#Projects

Project Name: Family <br>
Description: Defines parent, grandparent, ancestor, descendant, sibling, uncle, and cousin relationships. Lets you run queries to find how people are connected. <br>
Skills Learned: Learned how to use Prolog to represent knowledge with facts and rules, apply logical reasoning, and build recursive relationships to infer new information


Project Name: Logistics <br>
Description:  Models a simple logistics system to check if trucks can pick up, move, or deliver packages between warehouses. <br>
Skills Learned: Learned to model real-world systems and apply logical reasoning using Prolog facts and rules. <br>


Project Name: Hospital <br>
Description: Models a hospital system, linking doctors, patients, and treatments, and checks if treatments are valid for patients or prescribable by doctors. <br>
Skills Learned: Learned to represent real-world relationships and apply logical reasoning in Prolog using facts and rules. <br>

Project Name:  Library <br>
Description: Models a library system, tracking books, students, and borrowing rules, and checks borrowing limits and book categories. <br>
Skills Learned: Learned to represent data and relationships, enforce rules, and perform queries using Prolog facts and logical reasoning <br>
